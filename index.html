	<p>In my personal point of view, I perfer dog rather than cat, as they are more clever than dog. Accroding to reserch, cat get less death rate in car accident than dog. Meanwhile, raising a cat is clear than dog, as cat always groom themself and they can clean their faces out in sand, that people won't spend a lot of time to clean up the room.</p>
